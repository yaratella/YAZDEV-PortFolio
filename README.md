## 🎬 Getting Started
Starting this project was a fun challenge! I only had my 6th grade coding class skills at first. I highly recommend watching **[HTML & CSS Full Course for Free 🌎 by Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw&t=1121s)** since it helped me a lot in creating this website.
